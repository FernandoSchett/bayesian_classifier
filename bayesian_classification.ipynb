Consequently, neural networks can be viewed as universal function approximators and possess the capability to learn underlying probability distributions, despite it not being their primary approach.\n"

    "A Bayesian network, is a graphical representation of probabilistic relationships between different variables. It's a powerful tool used to model uncertain situations and make predictions between a lot of non-indepent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of Bayesian networks lies in their ability to update probabilities when new information is available. Let's say one event occurs, and we want to know how it affects the likelihood of another event happening. Bayesian networks allow us to do this by applying Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probabilities and the new evidence. To make predictions using a Bayesian network, we follow a process called \"inference.\" It involves using the network to calculate the probabilities of events, given the evidence we have. Let's discorver more with a example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The farmer faces concerns about the security of his valuable orange farm during the night while he is **sleeping** because he fears the possibility of **thieves** invading the property to steal his precious fruits. To protect his plantation, he has installed a sensitive **alarm** system that is triggered if it detects the presence of intruders on the farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the farmer realizes that the alarm can be triggered not only by **thieves** but also by the farm's **sheeps** or **thunders** during the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make more informed decisions about when to activate the alarm and ensure the **safety** of the oranges, the farmer has decided to use a probabilistic model known as \"Bayesian Network.\" This Bayesian Network consists of five random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IntruderPresence**: This variable represents the presence of intruders on the farm during the night. It can take two possible states: \"True\" if intruders are present and \"False\" if the farm is secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SheepPresence**: This variable represents the presence of sheep on the farm during the night. Sheep roaming around could potentially trigger the alarm. It can take two states: \"True\" if sheep are present and \"False\" if there are no sheep.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thunder**: This variable represents the occurrence of thunder during the night. Thunder can also trigger the sensitive alarm system. It can take two states: \"True\" if there is thunder and \"False\" if there is no thunder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AlarmTriggered**: This variable represents whether the alarm system is triggered or not. It can take two states: \"True\" if the alarm is triggered and \"False\" if it remains inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FarmerWakeUp**: This variable represents the farmer's decision to wake up and defend the oranges in the event of a potential threat. It can take two states: \"True\" if the farmer wakes up and defends the oranges, and \"False\" if the farmer remains asleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OrangeSafety**: This variable represents the safety of the oranges on the farm. It can take two states: \"1\" if the oranges are secure and \"0\" if there is a potential threat to the oranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to develop a solution to predict the probability of each event within the Bayesian Network, to do that, the following were probabilities collected by the farmer, using his dataset ```./datasets/night_farm_dataset.csv```. Now, it's yout challenge to:\n",
